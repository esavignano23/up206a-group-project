# Transportation in South Africa Group Update
## Corridors of Tolerance: The effect of post-apartheid public transit development on racial attitudes in Guateng, South Africa, [Project Proposal](https://github.com/esavignano23/up206a-group-project/blob/main/group%20assignments/Project_Proposal.md)
### Group Roles
- **Yasmina** aka the Queen of Social Indicators. Yasmina will be taking the lead on exploring and mapping of data related to racial attitudes, SES, education level etc.
- **Elena** aka the Queen of Transport. Elena will be taking the lead on exploring and mapping of transport data such as proximity to public transit, frequency of use, and modes of transportation.

Though we will be working on these two broad categories, we will continuously share updates and collaborate to "merge" our work during Week 5/6
### Status Update

Overall our team is feeling enthusiastic about our project and hopeful about our final outcome. We find the work to be interesting and are proud of what we've explored and mapped thus far! Our communication is working well. We check in with each other regularly to provide updates, brainstorm, and ask questions. In terms of what's not working ðŸ˜…
- We're struggling with python vocabulary and how to google the code we need to produce what we have in mind. It's pretty time consuming work and oftentimes ends with us still encountering errors in our code
- Another aspect we're struggling with is determining what will work as a visual presentation and what won't; what type of map works best with what type of data; and what packages we need to import to achieve certain goals
- Perhaps our biggest struggle is determining what we can accomplish within a certain amount of time and determining whether something we want to explore and map is feasible within our time frame

### Data update: 

So far we've explored the [2017-2018 GCRO Quality of Life Survey](https://github.com/esavignano23/up206a-group-project/blob/main/group%20assignments/qols-v-2017-2018-v1.1.csv.zip). Our plan is to show changes in attitudes over time, based around when certain bus routes/rail routes were implemented. This requires us to explore and map data from surveys that were done before and after implementation and comparing how things have changed. We plan to look at the [2011 Quality of Life Survey](https://github.com/esavignano23/up206a-group-project/blob/main/group%20assignments/gcro%202011_28feb12nogis-v1-s10.csv), [2013-2014 Quality of Life Survey](https://github.com/esavignano23/up206a-group-project/blob/main/group%20assignments/qol-iii-2013-2014-v1.csv), and the [2015-2016 Quality of Life Survey](https://github.com/esavignano23/up206a-group-project/blob/main/group%20assignments/qol-iv-2015-2016-v1-csv.zip). These surveys correspond with construction of BRT systems in Gauteng. 

We are still waiting to receive the [Gauteng Bus Stop Dataset](https://gisportal.gauteng.gov.za/portal/home/item.html?id=418d284c8e2f451e90485fad49b6b680#data) from the Gauteng planning division. Elena has been in correspondence with staff members at the Office of the Premier and has submitted the dataset request form. 

### Concerns: 

 #### Major Concerns:
- Our major concern is getting access to the bus data. Though we've put in a request, we still haven't received the dataset. This is an essential part of the project. We are wondering if it's feasible to map out individual bus stops ourselves (as a back up option). 
- Both of our notebooks keep shutting down when working with our datasets. We're thinking this might have to do with the size of the data being pulled / mapped? 
- We have a piece missing from our map (Rand City West) and have been unsuccessful at retaining it in our dataset

 #### Minor Concerns
- We are curious to learn the accepted approach of how to map changes over time, specifically comparing attitudes from year to year after certain bus routes were implemented
