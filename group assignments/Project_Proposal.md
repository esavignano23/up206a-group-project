# Project Proposal
## Corridors of Tolerance: The effect of post-apartheid public transit development on racial attitudes in Gauteng, South Africa 
Transit Oriented Development (TOD), specifically Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems have emerged as a panacea to a range of social and economic problems cities are facing. Many African cities are developing grand and costly TOD visions, when in fact there is little evidence that they deliver on the promises policy makers outline. BRTs funded by the World Bank and other development partners are seen as a sustainable and cost-effective “win-win” solution across Africa. Over the last 12 years, a range of cities including Dar es Salaam, Johannesburg, Accra, Maputo and Lagos have either developed or are in the process of developing a BRT. In Johannesburg, the BRT has been hailed as a way to overcome racial inequalities that were entrenched in the city’s urban planing during apartheid by expanding access to economic opportunities.

In few countries was city planning so explicitly racialised as in South Africa. In many cities in South Africa, the majority of the Black population lived in segregated residential enclaves where they had limited access to public transportation, restricting accessibility to economic and social life. Reformist mayors of post-apartheid South African cities have turned to transit oriented development as a corrective for these issues. 

However little empirical research has been conducted on whether bus and rail systems have led to integration and increased tolerance between racial groups. Our focus will be on the Gauteng region in South Africa. Using Gauteng’s City-Regional Observatory Quality of Life (QoL) survey data, we will explore if the Transit Oriented Development vision, which includes the implementation of a BRT and rail system in the Gauteng region has changed attitudes towards race. Gauteng is an ideal case for the study of this hypothesis as South Africa has high levels of racial tension (GCRO) and therefore TOD has the potential for significant impact. 

Our project is to create spatial visualization of whether and how racial attitudes have changed in areas where the city’s TOD vision has implemented bus and rail lines. Using several rounds of the Quality of Life survey conducted by the Gauteng Regional Observatory (GCRO) we are able to map on a ward level what attitudes towards racial groups, minorities and foreigners are. We will then map how these trends have changed along bus and rail routes that have been developed since 2009 (first round of the Quality of Life survey). While a map does not allow us to control for factors as a statistical analysis would, by looking at change in attitudes towards race from previous QoL surveys in the aforementioned areas, we will be able to at least see whether BRT potentially has an effect. 

## Data sources for the study

**Quality of Life Surveys**: Our primary data set that we will use for this analysis is the GCRO’s quality of life survey. The biennial Quality of Life (QoL) survey, first conducted in 2009, measures the quality of life, socio-economic circumstances, attitudes to service delivery, psycho-social attitudes, value-base and other characteristics of the Gauteng City Region. It serves as a tracking and diagnostic tool, affording a rich information resource for policymakers and the public wanting to see where progress is being made, and where concerns remain.

**General Household Survey**: We will also be using the latest general household survey conducted in 2020, of which we have access to [a sample through datafirst](https://www.datafirst.uct.ac.za/dataportal/index.php/catalog/887/related-materials), a data portal for open access data on Africa managed by the University of Capetown. 

**Wards in Gauteng Region** The Municipal Demarcation Board of South Africa has spatial data available of Guateng wards. The shapefile data can be found on our group repo [here](https://github.com/esavignano23/up206a-group-project/blob/main/group%20assignments/MDB_Wards_2020.zip)

**Bus and Train Lines in Gauteng**: Though data is available for railway stations in Gauteng from the Gauteng City Region Integrated Geospatial Data Platform, it is not available for download. We will be requesting access to download a shapefile for bus and rail lines.
